Workflow


email templates	These can be grouped, rather than targeting a specific person, so multiple people can receive the same
		type of email. Perf. example would be the ANU Textbook Exchange email type

		By disconnecting the template from the user_id, there needs to be an association somewhere connecting the two
		Obvs location would be the userlist.csv file.


Email.py  	sends out an email to a specific user_id and email address using a given template
		records the fact that the email has gone out into the database - needs to connect to PHP database functions

userlist.csv	contains the list of email addresses and associated user_ids


Whats needed is a script of some sort to read the CSV file and then send out the emails, one at a time.
CSV reader suggests Python would be the way to go

It would also be really handy if the database interface were written in Python as well


Yet the SQL schema is currently defined in PHP.

Best solution would be to make the SQL schema language-agnostic, though it's not clear what form that could take given that
PHP is such a useless lump of shite.


Backlog:

- Convert spear phishing templates to Python email script templates as already defined.
- Match spear phishing template usernames to UIDs
- Associated them with the appropriate records in the CSV file
- DONE Create a database interface within PHP that the Python email scripts could link to, to record email transmission
- Create a Python script to parse the CSV file and call the emailer on each entry.
- Include within that Python script a 'test mode' that directs all outgoing emails to the test user '5809912' and does not record transmission
  in the database

Wishlist
- Make the SQL schema language-agnostic so both the PHP and Python scripts can read/write to the database without doubling up on code
- Move the entire database interface to Python
